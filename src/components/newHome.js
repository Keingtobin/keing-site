I graduated from CU Boulder with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Philosophy. My interests include full stack web development, GIS and its applications, and creating robust scalable applications. One of my greatest strengths is being able to learn new technologies.</p>
                    <p class="body_text">In my free time away from the desk I enjoy skiing, running, hiking, climbing, and going to concerts.</p>
                    <p class="body_text">This site isn't meant to be pretty. The purpose of it is to serve as a spot to show off all the projects I work on outside of school. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any ideas to expand my projects. I would love to collaborate!</p>                <h2 class="header">Contact Info</h2>
